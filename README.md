# Tic-tac-toe

Because the application was developed with a simple IDE (jGrasp) I do not guarantee that it will work on other IDE's as well. Please do not change the names of files as that would make the application unstable.

This project uses the uses minmax and alpha beta algorithms.
It's a game with one player.

All classes are written by me, so the ready code has not been received.
I made this project a long time ago (when i started programing) so maybe the comments and the code are not as good as they must be.
